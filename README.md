I was born in 1998 and I used to be a statistics Undergradute student in BNU-HKBU UIC and I am now the Research Assistant in STAT department(BNU-HKBU UIC).
I am also one of the co-founders of [@UICHCC](https://uichcc.com) (UIC Computer Club) and Cyclododecene, a data analysis group;
My final year project is about “Acceralte the Asymmetric Crypto-system with GPU”, which is not statistics-related, as my supervisor is a professor in physics. His interest is in numerical computing & computer science.

🔭 I’m currently working on Beijing Normal University - Hong Kong Baptist Universtiy Department of Statistics as a Research Assistant. As being a RA, I am now focusing on Financical Data Analsis (the data correlated to the finance market, not just finance data):
